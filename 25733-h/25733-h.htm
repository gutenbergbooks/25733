<h2>Tam o' Shanter.</h2>

<hr />
<p class="title">A Tale.</p>
<hr />

<div class="poem">

<p><span class="firstline">WHEN chapman billies leave the street,</span><br />
And drouthy neebors, neebors meet,<br />
As market-days are wearing late,<br />
An' folk begin to tak the gate;<br />
While we sit bousing at the nappy,<br />
An' getting fou and unco happy,<br />
We think na on the lang Scots miles,<br />
The mosses, waters, slaps, and styles,<br />
That lie between us and our hame,<br />
Whar sits our sulky sullen dame,<br />
Gathering her brows like gathering storm,<br />
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.</p>

<p>This truth fand honest Tam o' Shanter,<br />
As he frae Ayr ae night did canter<br />
(Auld Ayr wham ne'er a town surpasses<br />
For honest men and bonny lasses).</p>

<p>O Tam! hadst thou but been sae wise,<br />
As ta'en thy ain wife Kate's advice!<br />
She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum,<br />
A blethering, blustering, drunken blellum;<br />
That frae November till October,<br />
Ae market-day thou was nae sober;<br />
That lika melder, wi' the miller,<br />
Thou sat as lang as thou had siller;<br />
That ev'ry naig was ca'd a shoe on,<br />
The smith and thee gat roaring fou on;<br />
That at the L&mdash;d's house, ev'n on Sunday,<br />
Thou drank wi' Kirton Jean till Monday.<br />
She prophesy'd that late or soon,<br />
Thou would be found deep drown'd in Doon;<br />
Or catch'd wi' warlocks in the mirk,<br />
By Alloway's auld haunted kirk.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet,<br />
To think how mony counsels sweet,<br />
How mony lengthen'd sage advices,<br />
The husband frae the wife despises!</p>

<p>But to our tale: Ae market night,<br />
Tam had got planted unco right;<br />
Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely,<br />
Wi' reaming swats, that drank divinely;<br />
And at his elbow, Souter Johnny,<br />
His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony;<br />
Tam lo'ed him like a vera brither;<br />
They had been fou for weeks thegither.<br />
The night drave on wi' sangs an' clatter;<br />
And ay the ale was growing better:<br />
The landlady and Tam grew gracious,<br />
Wi' favors, secret, sweet, and precious:<br />
The Souter tauld his queerest stories;<br />
The landlord's laugh was ready chorus:<br />
The storm without might rair and rustle,<br />
Tam did na mind the storm a whistle.</p>

<p>Care, mad to see a man sae happy,<br />
E'en drown'd himself amang the nappy,<br />
As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure,<br />
The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure:<br />
Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious,<br />
O'er a' the ills o' life victorious!</p>

<p>But pleasures are like poppies spread,<br />
You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed;<br />
Or like the snow-falls in the river,<br />
A moment white&mdash;then melt forever;<br />
Or like the borealis race,<br />
That flit ere you can point their place;<br />
Or like the rainbow's lovely form<br />
Evanishing amid the storm.&mdash;<br />
Nae man can tether time or tide;<br />
The hour approaches Tam maun ride;<br />
That hour, o' night's black arch the key-stane,<br />
That dreary hour he mounts his beast in,<br />
And sic a night he taks the road in;<br />
As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.</p>

<span class="caption">Well mounted on his grey mare, Meg.</span></p>

<div class="poem">

<p>The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last;<br />
The rattling show'rs rose on the blast;<br />
The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd;<br />
Loud, deep, and lang the thunder bellowed:<br />
That night, a child might understand,<br />
The deil had business on his hand.</p>

<p>Weel mounted on his grey mare, Meg,<br />
A better never lifted leg,<br />
Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire,<br />
Despising wind, and rain, and fire;<br />
Whiles holding fast his gude blue bonnet;<br />
Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet;<br />
Whiles glow'ring round wi' prudent cares,<br />
Lest bogles catch him unawares:<br />
Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh,<br />
Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry.&mdash;</p>

<p>By this time he was cross the ford,<br />
Whare in the snaw the chapman smoor'd;<br />
And past the birks and meikie stane,<br />
Whare drunken Charlie brak's neck-bane;<br />
And thro' the whins, and by the cairn,<br />
Whare hunters fand the murder'd bairn;<br />
And near the thorn, aboon the well,<br />
Whare Mungo's mither hang'd hersel.&mdash;<br />
Before him Doon pours all his floods;<br />
The doubling storm roars thro' the woods;<br />
The lightnings flash from pole to pole;<br />
Near and more near the thunders roll:<br />
When, glimmering thro' the groaning trees,<br />
Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze;<br />
Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing;<br />
And loud resounded mirth and dancing.&mdash;</p>

<p>Inspiring bold John Barleycorn!<br />
What dangers thou canst make us scorn;<br />
Wi' tippenny, we fear nae evil;<br />
Wi' usquabae we'll face the devil!&mdash;<br />
The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle,<br />
Fair play, he car'd na deils a boddle.<br />
But Maggie stood right sair astonish'd,<br />
Till, by the heel and hand admonish'd,<br />
She ventur'd forward on the light:<br />
And, <a name="vow" id="vow"></a>vow! Tam saw an unco sight!<br />
Warlocks and witches in a dance;<br />
Nae cotillion brent new frae France,<br />
But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels,<br />
Put life and mettle in their heels.<br />
A winnock-bunker in the east,<br />
There sat auld Nick, in shape o' beast;<br />
A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large,<br />
To gie them music was his charge;<br />
He screw'd the pipes and gart them skirl,<br />
Till roof and rafters a' did dirl.&mdash;<br />
Coffins stood round, like open presses,<br />
That shaw'd the dead in their last dresses;<br />
And by some devilish cantrip slight,<br />
Each in its cauld hand held a light.&mdash;<br />
By which heroic Tam was able<br />
To note upon the haly table,<br />
A murderer's banes in gibbet airns;<br />
Twa span-lang, wee, unchristen'd bairns;<br />
A thief, new-cutted frae a rape,<br />
Wi' his last gasp his gab did gape;<br />
Five tomahawks, wi' blude red-rusted;<br />
Five scymitars, wi' murder crusted;<br />
A garter, which a babe had strangled;<br />
A knife, a father's throat had mangled,<br />
Whom his ain son o' life bereft,<br />
The gray hairs yet stack to the heft:<br />
Wi' mair o' horrible and awfu',<br />
Which ev'n to name wad be unlawfu'.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>As Tammie glowr'd, amaz'd, and curious,<br />
The mirth and fun grew fast and furious:<br />
The piper loud and louder blew:<br />
The dancers quick and quicker flew;<br />
They reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit,<br />
Till ilka carlin swat and reekit,<br />
And coost her duddies to the wark,<br />
And linket at it in her sark!<br />
Now Tam, O Tam! had thae been queans<br />
A' plump and strapping, in their teens:<br />
Their sarks, instead o' creeshie flannen,<br />
Been snaw-white seventeen hunder linen!<br />
Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair,<br />
That ance were plush, o' gude blue hair,<br />
I wad hae gi'en them off my hurdies,<br />
For ae blink o' the bonnie burdies!</p>

<p>But wither'd beldams, auld and droll,<br />
Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal,<br />
Lowping an' flinging on a crummock,<br />
I wonder didna turn thy stomach.</p>

<p>But Tam kend what was what fu' brawlie,<br />
There was ae winsome wench and walie,<br />
That night enlisted in the core<br />
(Lang after kend on Carrick shore;<br />
For mony a beast to dead she shot,<br />
And perish'd mony a bonnie boat,<br />
And shook baith meikle corn and bear,<br />
And kept the country-side in fear),<br />
Her cutty sark, o' Paisley harn,<br />
That while a lassie she had worn,<br />
In longitude tho' sorely scanty,<br />
It was her best, and she was vauntie.&mdash;<br />
Ah! little kend thy reverend grannie,<br />
That sark she coft for her wee Nannie,<br />
Wi' twa pund Scots ('twas a' her riches),<br />
Wad ever grac'd a dance of witches!</p>

<p>But here my muse her wing maun cour;<br />
Sic flights are far beyond her pow'r;<br />
To sing how Nannie lap and flang<br />
(A souple jade she was and strang),<br />
And how Tam stood like ane bewitch'd,<br />
And thought his very een enrich'd;<br />
Even Satan glowr'd, and fidg'd fu' fain,<br />
And hotch'd and blew wi' might and main:<br />
Till first ae caper, syne anither,<br />
Tam tint his reason a' thegither,<br />
And roars out, "Weel done, Cutty-sark!"<br />
And in an instant all was dark;<br />
And scarcely had he Maggie rallied,<br />
When out the hellish legion sallied.</p>

<p>As bees bizz out wi' angry fyke,<br />
When plundering herds assail their byke;<br />
As open pussie's mortal foes,<br />
When, pop! she starts before their nose;<br />
As eager runs the market-crowd,<br />
When "Catch the thief!" resounds aloud;<br />
So Maggie runs, the witches follow,<br />
Wi' mony an eldritch skreech and hollow.</p>

<p>Ah, Tam! Ah, Tam! thou'll get thy fairin!<br />
In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin!<br />
In vain thy Kate awaits thy coming!<br />
Kate soon will be a woefu' woman!<br />
Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg,<br />
An win the key-stane<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of the brig;<br />
There at them thou thy tail may toss,<br />
A running stream they dare na cross.<br />
But ere the key-stane she could make,<br />
The fient a tail she had to shake!<br />
For Nannie, far before the rest,<br />
Hard upon noble Maggie prest,<br />
And flew at Tam wi' furious ettle;<br />
But little wist she Maggie's mettle&mdash;<br />
Ae spring brought off her master hale,<br />
But left behind her ain gray tail:<br />
The carlin claught her by the rump,<br />
And left poor Maggie scarce a stump.</p>

<p>Now, wha this tale o' truth shall read,<br />
Ilk man and mother's son, take heed;<br />
Whene'er to drink you are inclin'd,<br />
Or cutty-sarks run in your mind,<br />
Think, ye may buy the joys o'er dear,<br />
Remember Tam o' Shanter's mare.</p>

have no power to follow a poor wight any farther than the middle of the
next running stream.&mdash;It may be proper likewise to mention to the
benighted traveller, that when he falls in with <i>bogles</i>, whatever
danger may be in his going forward, there is much more hazard in turning
back.</p>
